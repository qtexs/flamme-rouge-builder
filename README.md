Flamme rouge builder website

Shout-out to Asger Harding Granerud for creating this beautiful game, and to the creator of the Flamme Rouge Companion app, which has been my inspiration for going about this.

Troubleshooting
This is a fan-made project I mostly created for myself, and I don‚Äôt have any experience hosting websites. If you run into problems, try opening it in Google Chrome and/or on a screen with higher resolution.

The site should be fairly intuitive, but here‚Äôs a quick guide:

- Click tiles from the panel on the left to add them to the stage. The site will track how many times each tile is placed.
- Undo removes the last tile, and Reset clears the whole stage.
- The site auto-zooms to fit the stage inside the frame. Since it isn‚Äôt perfect, I added manual zoom buttons. You can also rotate the stage.
- To add checkpoints: enter a name and choose a color, press Add, then click the tile where the checkpoint should go. Finally, enter the number of squares from left to right.
- The site tracks metadata and stats, but sprint points and KOM points must be entered manually if you want them included in the download.
- Press Download Stage to open a preview and download options. Press Download again to save the stage as a PNG.

Planned features in decreasing priority, no plan planned timeline here, just when I get around to doing it:

1) Add the promotional tile.
2) Add a "Replace Tile" button to swap tiles and auto aligne other placed tiles.
3) Add an "Auto Rotate" toggle so that the last placed tile exit point always points to the right.
4) Enable "Save Stage" and "Load Stage" buttons so one can safe a json file of the stage which can be loaded later if one wants to continue, change or share it.
5) Make the website usable on mobile.
6) Add an upload tile feature. I‚Äôm not sure about this one, maybe I could provide a template for tiles from Figma, and then people could create and upload their own custom SVG tile files in the website.

Disclaimer

English is not my first language, so there may be spelling mistakes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The tiles were made in Figma, some are a bit crooked, but the proportions and angles should be correct.

I have not tested nor made it for mobile so I would imagend that it don‚Äôt work.

This is a non-commercial fan project. If using the name Flamme Rouge is a copyright issue, I‚Äôll rename it to "Cycling Board Game Builder" or something similar.
